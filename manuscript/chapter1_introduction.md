# Chapter 1: Introduction

The role of the full-stack developer has long been celebrated for its versatility—combining backend and frontend expertise to build seamless, end-to-end applications. But as technology evolves, so do the expectations for developers.

In today’s world, users demand more than just functional apps. They want **intelligent applications** that can anticipate their needs, personalize experiences, and adapt dynamically. This shift is driven by the rapid rise of **AI**.

This book is about redefining the role of the full-stack developer for the future. It’s not enough to master backend and frontend anymore. To be truly competitive and future-proof your career, you need to incorporate **AI and data science** into your skill set. This book will guide you on the journey to becoming the ultimate full-stack developer, capable of building intelligent, end-to-end applications that combine backend, frontend, and AI.

## Hands-On: A Simple Flask Example

To get started with a basic backend framework, you can explore a simple Flask application.

The code for this example is available in the repository:

[flask_basic_example.py](../code/chapter1/flask_basic_example.py)

### Steps:
1. Download the code from the link above.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python flask_basic_example.py
   ```
3. Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser to see the output.

This example demonstrates how to create a minimal backend service, which we will expand upon in later chapters.
